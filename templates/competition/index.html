                We (Nvana) will bring the latest learning from Lean Startup™ and business model innovation, plus the tools and mentors needed to deliver it to your students. We'll run both the workshops and online competition and provide the tools and information needed for you to run a similar program yourselves next year.
                </p>
                <p>
                You (the institution) provide a workshop space for the events and help promote the events and encourage students to participate.
                </p>
                <p>
                We'll all work together to find the most appropriate source of funding, whether it is innovation grants like HEIF, corporate sponsors, or the startup and investor eco-system. We'll also collaborate on customising the workshops to your students' needs & interests.
                </p>
                <p>
                Some example programs include commercialising post-graduate research, starting a creative small business, developing social enterprises, bootstrapping scalable technology startups, and general startup literacy.

                <h3>Case study</h3>

                <p>
                UCL's E Challenge had 650 applicants to their 4-phase competition, supplemented by weekly workshop events. Ultimately, 30 finalists gave live presentations, which were evaluated in combination with their online submissions to select winners across 4 categories for prizes totaling €20,000.
                </p>
                <p>
                Nvana was used throughout the event for application management and judging. Its use saved significant amounts of organizer time related to judging and allowed teams to receive their judge feedback immediately.
                </p>
                <p>
                Since then, UCL has run two additional events using Nvana, giving out nearly €100,000 to student entrepreneurs through the platform.

                <h3>Avoid the dollhouse fallacy</h3>
                <p>
                Startups are <i>not</i> miniature versions of big companies. As such, the business advice and strategic tools developed in a corporate context are frequently irrelevant and can even be damaging to young startups. The most important activities for a founder are learning and iteration, not planning and execution.
                </p>

                <h3>Embrace extreme uncertainty</h3>
                <p>
                Startups are solving <i>unknown</i> problems for <i>unknown</i> customers by building an <i>unknown</i> solution. Under such conditions, asking founders to plan years ahead is an exercise in futility. Instead of disguising guesses as budgets and roadmaps, founders should be taught to reduce their business risks through an iterative, experimental approach.
                </p>

                <h3>Prioritise deep customer understanding</h3>
                <p>
                The fastest, cheapest, and most effective way to improve a startup's odds of success is for its founders to constantly be talking to potential customers. Instead of treating is as a sidenote, gathering customer feedback is considered a crucial deliverable and disproving your core beliefs is celebrated as progress.

                <h3>Speed trumps planning</h3>
                <p>
                The four most difficult parts of creating a startup are 1) forming a team, 2) discovering a worthwhile problem to solve, 3) articulating a value proposition, and 4) finding your first customer. Roughly 3½ of those can (and should!) be tackled by students. Instead of wasting time polishing an imperfect plan, let's see them race for real progress.
