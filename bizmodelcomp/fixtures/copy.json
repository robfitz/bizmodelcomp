Is it \"Nir-va-na\" like the band or Buddhist ideal or \"N-vana\" like the yellow bendy fruit?! We'll let you decide.\r\n\r\nAny way we're certainly not the <a href=http://www.nvana.org/ title=\"Nevada Association of Nurse Anesthetists\" target=\"_blank\">Nevada Association of Nurse Anesthetists</a>! NVANA was founded out of a belief that <highlight>entrepreneurs are important</highlight>, really important. Given this belief, we want to build tools to teach, mentor & fund entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\nOur plan is to work with the best in teaching, mentoring and funding and help them do what they do even better. Think [Steve Blank](http://steveblank.com/ \"Steve Blank's blog\"), [Seedcamp](http://seedcamp.com/ \"Seedcamp's website\")...etc. etc. We want to help spread best practice around the world.\r\n\r\nOur first \"app\" (apparently everything is an \"app\" these days) is a tool to power competitions. More specifically <highlight>business plan competitions</highlight>, you'll soon hear a lot more about [business model competitions](http://www.businessmodelcompetition.com/ \"BYU's Business Model Competition website\").\r\n\r\nIn this endeavour we've been lucky enough to work with the [London Entrepreneurs' Challenge](http://www.londonentrepreneurschallenge.com/ \"London Entrepreneurs' Challenge website\") (commonly referred to as E Challenge) in supporting over 500 student entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\nSo why are we doing this? Two reasons in particular:\r\n\r\n* Entrepreneurship education is, by and large, missing the point <sup>[1]</sup>\r\n* Entrepreneurs fail for stupid reasons <sup>[2]</sup>\r\n\r\nWe think both of these issues are resolvable and we think the best way to achieve this with any real impact is by providing tools to entrepreneurs via educators, business plan competitions, seed accelerators and the like. First in Europe and then the rest of the world.\r\n\r\nWe hope you share our ambitions and aspirations, if so feel free to [get in touch](http://www.nvana.com/contact \"Contact us\").\r\n\r\nMore importantly, watch this space!\r\n\r\n##Key points\r\n\r\n* Entrepreneurs are important\r\n* Entrepreneurship education misses the mark & entrepreneurs fail for stupid reasons\r\n* NVANA is dedicated to building tools to support the teaching, mentoring and funding of entrepreneurs\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class='small'>\r\n\r\n[1] Not everywhere obviously, [Stanford University](http://stvp.stanford.edu/ \"Stanford Technology Ventures Program website\") and others can and should hold their heads up high as evidence of that. But in the words of [NACUE](http://www.nacue.com \"NACUE's website\") \"The quality of entrepreneurship education is disparate and unequal...\"\r\n\r\n[2] It's true! By \"stupid\" we mean \"easily avoidable\".\r\n\r\n</div>"
