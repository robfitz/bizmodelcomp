Hello ++team name++,

Thanks for being a part of the %s. Everyone did a impressive work and we look forward to seeing these ideas grow into successful companies.

Below you'll find the feedback from judges. It's un-edited and was written on the fly, so apologies in advance if you receive something that's overly obscure. Please feel free to follow up with the judges if you'd like additional info.

Your business plan was scored in the __++online rank++ third__ of the scores and your live pitch was in the __++live rank++ third__.

__Business plan: Positive__

++online positive++

__Business plan: To Improve__

++online negative++

__Live pitch: Positive__
